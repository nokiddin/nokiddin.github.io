Chat based retail-commerce.  
  Unique model to match local retailers to customers over a chat 
  channel. 
  The "system" consisting of mobile application and a cloud hosted server
  backend matches customers to local merchants over a chat channel 
  automatically based on location, customer profile and the "fan out" query 
  posted by a customer. The query is sent by the system to matching 
  retailers, who then get to engage with the customer on a chat channel 
  managed by the system. A customer can simultaneously talk to multiple 
  merchants for his shopping query. Merchants can engage customers posting 
  media content for their wares and also converse real time with users.
